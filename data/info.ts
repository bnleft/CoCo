export const ABOUTUS_MESSAGE1 = `
**Welcome to Code[Coogs]!** <:cocodetermined:901187436523163648>  
We are UH’s newest student-led organization that focuses on coding competitions and building a community of programmers. The key aspects of our club are: workshops, competitions, socials, and community. 

**Our Discord** <:cocodetermined:901187436523163648>     
Thi is where all the members hang out and collaborate with each other. Go to <#897608615404400700> and add roles that describe you! Feel free to vibe out and create memes with our own custom bots, CoCo and CoCo-Beats! These bots are designed to facilitate things around the discord like reacting with memes and playing music. Also, show off your awesome art skills in <#902735809973719060>!

**Competitions** <:cocodetermined:901187436523163648>  
Every two weeks we will hold a competition that will put your skills to the test. Each competition will push you to become a better programmer. The skills you gain from solving these problems will show when you do technical interviews!

**Workshops** <:cocodetermined:901187436523163648>  
Workshops are where our members will develop their programming skills and gain confidence in their problem-solving skills. Workshops will go over challenging problems that utilize a variety of programming concepts, and students will learn the patterns and techniques used to tackle these problems. It is encouraged to collaborate and bounce ideas off of one another to understand different angles of solving these problems!

**Socials** <:cocodetermined:901187436523163648>  
The socials are a time for Code Coogs’ members to kick back and relax. Whether it is a sports day at a park or a virtual movie night, our socials are sure to enable our members to get closer to one another to promote the community aspect within our members. Show up to our in-person socials for a good time!

@everyone

As the year comes to a close, 
Coco reflects back on their time 
With all of the friends that they made, 
The experiences were worth every dime 

They were good and they were bad, 
they were shy and they were bold 
Coco was excited for the new year
where new stories would unfold 

Coco looks forward to the future
with each passing day 
On behalf of Code Coogs, 
Coco would like to say, 

Tell those you love and the ones you hold dear 
Merry Christmas and have a happy new year!
